        <p>FLEEING THE DARKNESS</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Radiant Promises is a project to help circumvent homelessness and
          hopelessness ages 18-24 at-risk teens and young adults who have aged
          out of the Foster Care System and those that have been rescued from
          the sex-trafficked industry.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The Radiant Promises project is founded by its CEO, Dolly Chacon, a
          Business Administrator, a retired Pastor, a Certified Master Life
          Coach, Marriage Coach, Mental Health Wellness Coach, Motivational
          Speaker, Talk Show Host and a Spiritual Mom to teens and young adults.
          The Radiant Promises project was launched by Dolly’s overwhelming
          gut-wrenching concern of a dream she had about a black cloud hovering
          over one side of a street miles long. Dolly said, "I saw thousands of
          children with fear and pain on their faces running for their lives out
          of this dark cloud into the light across the street. The light
          engulfed thousands of family-oriented people with smiles and open arms
          of love waiting to embrace these children. I immediately realized no
          matter how many teens and young adults I life coached, more
          importantly, they needed nurturing and housing stability to help
          circumvent the fear of abuse and homelessness." Dolly states, "our
          youth cannot be left to the dark, loveless and lifeless streets. It's
          a crime here in America to do so."
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The Radiant Promises project has five components: transitional
          residences, educational, work readiness and moral values and youth
          wellness services. We provide an honorable family environment to
          homeless youth ages 18-24. Some have aged-out of the Foster Care
          program and have been sexually abused or rescued from sex-trafficking,
          situations with no safe home to return to.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Every night thousands of teens have no bed to curl up in, in a safe
          and caring home. Many are forced to the streets and are forced into
          prostitution, gangs, alcoholism, drugs, and crimes. Many are
          sex-trafficked in order to find a place to lay their heads while in
          constant fear of continued abuse. These young people need a safe
          caring environment to transition and learn constructive healthy and
          productive ways to live their adult lifestyle. We are those who
          sincerely care about their welfare and offer the tools to help them
          transition through to a new day, a new life, full of hope. Too many of
          our young people are poor, vulnerable, hopeless and hurting with no
          moral or spiritual support. Many become suicidal and we are committed
          to providing spiritually centered, holistic care which sustains and
          improves mental, emotional and spiritual well-being after they found
          themselves once again abandoned by the Foster Care system, the
          government with no supportive family.

          The Radiant Promises project is a mix of successful entrepreneurs,
          businessmen and women, spiritual counselors and concerned community
          members who have united for a common vision for social change for
          those who are at risk of homelessness. The union of the Radiant
          Promises’ Team, the Business Model, the Partners, and Organizations
          will result in a full-service protocol that is intended to help
          improve the future of emancipated foster care and/or sex-trafficked
          young people. We proclaim, they are "Victims No More, but a Shining
          Light in the World!"
